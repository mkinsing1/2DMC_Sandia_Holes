1) scattering_table.f
   - Changed degeneracies to 1
   - Mapped HH=1,LH=2,SO=3
   - Added variables and function calls for alloy_disorder and coulomb_scattering
     ToDo: Write functions for alloy_disorder and coulomb_scattering  
     ToDo: Alloy disorder scattering coupling constant (sigma_alloy_scattering)
